# Individual differences in speech, reading, and mental health


## Project Goal
This study aims to understand how individual differences in reading and speech behaviors relate to particular cognitive abilities, personality and social factors, as well as mental health outcomes such as social anxiety.


## Background & Design
Prior work suggests that individuals with the temperament type known as “behavioral inhibition” are more likely to develop social anxiety if they also demonstrate particular profiles of cognitive control abilities (White et al., 2011; Buzzell et al., 2020). It remains unclear how much these associations depend on social context. Additionally, it remains unclear if these associations depend on the temperament of the individual, other personality or social factors, or are present for the majority of individuals with social anxiety. There is at least some work suggesting links between some forms of cognitive control (e.g., error monitoring) and social anxiety are influenced by social contexts (Buzzell et al., 2017).

There is little work investigating the effect of social context on relations between social anxiety and more ecologically valid measures of cognitive control (e.g., cognitive control during speech and reading). The current study aims to not only close these gaps in the literature, but also provide a broader investigation of how particular cognitive abilities, and personality or social factors, relate to mental health outcomes and real-world scenarios. Towards these ends, participants will perform a reading aloud task twice, once while alone and once while being observed by the experimenter. Additionally, the participants will complete a set of traditional cognitive control tasks (flanker task, dimensional change card sort task, n-back task). Task development was based on the modification of existing paradigms. Participants will also complete a more general battery of questionnaires to assess their thoughts and feelings before and after completing the tasks.
