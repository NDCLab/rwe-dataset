# Individual differences in speech, reading, and mental health


## Project Goal
This study aims to understand how individual differences in reading and speech behaviors relate to particular cognitive abilities, personality and social factors, as well as mental health outcomes, such as social anxiety.


## Background & Design
Prior work suggests that individuals with the temperament type known as “behavioral inhibition” are more likely to develop social anxiety if they also demonstrate particular profiles of cognitive control abilities ([White et al., 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10802-011-9490-x); [Buzzell et al., 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-814411-4.00024-X)). However, it remains unclear to what degree these associations depend on social context and whether these associations depend on the temperament of the individual, other personality or social factors, or are present for the majority of individuals with social anxiety. There is some work suggesting that links between some of cognitive control (e.g., error monitoring) and social anxiety are influenced by social observation ([Buzzell et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2017.10.007)).

Few studies have investigated the effect of social observation on relations between social anxiety and more ecologically valid measures of cognitive control (e.g., cognitive control during speech and reading). The current study aims not only to close these gaps in the literature, but also to provide a broader investigation of how particular cognitive abilities, as well as personality and social factors, relate to mental health outcomes in real-world scenarios. Towards these ends, participants perform a reading aloud task twice, once while alone and once while being observed by the experimenter; they also perform a set of traditional cognitive control tasks (flanker task, dimensional change card sort task, n-back task–task development was based on the modification of existing paradigms). Participants complete a general battery of questionnaires to assess their thoughts and feelings before and after completing the tasks.
